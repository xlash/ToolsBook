# Default files imported back from a customer will preserve identity. Such as root will be preserve

!!!!Don't run your containers with root




## Useful commands
CTRL+PQ (hide in background)

docker inspect -f "{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}" netwebserver

Quick Web server
    docker run --name=netwebserver -d nginx 


List containers disk usage
    docker system df
    docker system prune (reclaims space, network, etc.)


Giving PS access is to be very careful


Runc doesn't handle networking itself. Docker does it under the cover

guardrails to protect resources


eBPF track containers even not running from the command line (Comment by Guillaume Ross)

## Networking
Port 2375 Default for unencrypted Docker http cconnection 2376 for https
!!!!2375 No authN no AuthZ   
2376 Mutual TLS by default


kubectl cheat sheed
Doccker Hub
3rdpartyreview github
VulnerableContainers.org
shodan.io/search?query=port%3A2375+docker

!!!!Docker network bridge ==> Should not be use in enterprises. Dangerous to bridge full network.sudop 

### List iptables
sudo iptables -L
They are modified automatically by exposing ports
  docker run --name=testnginx -d -p 8000:80 nginx

bride-utilities
brctl show


### Host network
!!!!loses some isolation (can access Localhost for example) 
    convenient, but dangerous. (Useful for local metasploit for example)

### MACVLAN
==>does not use DHCP

### Overlay Network (swarm and kubernetes)
Rarely encrypted for performance reason


## Other networking plugins from vendor

Docker stop all  : docker ps | awk 'NR!=1 {print $14}' | xargs docker stop
docker stop $(docker ps -q)



Docker for mac or Windows, runs a virtual machine behind it,

apk is alpine linux apt


# Building Docker images
Image name without a / means it was locally built


!!!!Docker files with Curl bashing

!!!! Somehow dangerous : Docker ADD will automatically unpack archives or fetch url. Use Docker COPY


!!!! Review docker CMD vs ENTRYPOINT
recommendations :
	many tools : CMD
	single entry point : ENTRYPOINT

!!!! change user from root to x user
	FROM ubuntu:18.04                                                                                                                                              │!!!! change user from root to x user     
	RUN groupadd -g 999 mcsuser && \                                                                                                                               │
	    useradd -r -u 999 -g mcsuser mcsuser                                                                                                                       │
	USER mcsuser    

Running ps -ef on the host you can see if UIDs are reused and mixed


COPY docker directive has a --chown flag

using RUN statements with chown or chmod isn't great as it bloats the image 

.dockerignore is available to specify what to exclude

ENV set environment varible for commands in the container.
!!!!Do not use for secret management



docker commit can be use to create new containers. NO registery of what was done however.
!!!!docker hub credentials are in base64 $HOME/.docker/config.json
!!!! have 2fa enabled
Docker hub is default registry for Docker

Internally Docker uses SHA-256 to refer to dockers, but names are easier

# Building Single Binary Container
Linux container are not a real thing
  Linux programs that responds to certain signals
  1. Smallest Assembly 1KB file 
  2. Smallest in golang 1.5MB 

Want to not leave GCC tools on the container


image golang:onbuild has all the tools to build a container
Multi stage built allows for tooling to stay in other containers, and not be in the final one

root in a container has a subset of capabilities. You can see this with pscap

  28986 29012 root        ash               chown, dac_override, fowner, fsetid, kill, setgid, setuid, setpcap, net_bind_service, net_raw, sys_chroot, mknod, audit_write, setfcap
  no sys_time capabilities


Docker grants default permission
!!!! Turnoff cap_net_raw capability should be disabled. Can allow ARP spoofing and potentially MITM container
By dropping it, we lose ping capability
You can manually add ping capability:
     docker run -it --sysctl "net.ipv4.ping_group_range=0 1000000000" --cap-drop=NET_RAW\ alpine ping -c 3 8.8.8.8

## Setting performance limits
docker run --cpus0.5 (half a core)

Docker susceptible to a fork bomb (running out of process ID). Unsecure by default
--pids-limit 10 (Pretty safe value by default)

seccomp profiles can allow a whitelist of syscalls to be allowed. Not recommended except for very specific usage.

Docker inspect won't show seccomp.
Should show "seccomp=unconfined" under "SecurityOpt" if it's disabled
## Kubernetes turns off any seccomp enable containers.
docker info | grep apparmor

## Man-in-the-middle docker client via socket
   Exercise - Using Socat to see traffic to the Docker socket
	sudo socat -v UNIX-LISTEN:/tmp/tempdock.sock,fork UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/docker.sock
	In another shell
	sudo docker -H unix:///tmp/tempdock.sock images

!!!! --privileged flag can be use to get rights to the underlying host



Kubectl needs --privileged

Exercise - "The most pointless Docker command ever"

Useful for a docker access on a host.

Things to look for - 4
Things to look for - 5

## What to look for 
1. Search for non registry containers
2. Dockers running dangerously? 
   Docker socket is mounted?


## Container Vuln Scanning
Less coverage with


## Vulnerability scanner/auditing
Use Clair-scanner
 

## Docker Builder Security
Docker Builder security runs as root. Carefull which machine runs it.

## AmI In a controller
/.dockerenv  => 0 bytes
PID 1 is not init


## Troubleshooting a container
Run the container mapping the namespace of the host to the container



    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-548r07f1dovnzh6oxz476h0xm3bjl808jaicia5yy3ry4elclv-etmmti45dknjztmih9oqciypb 172.17.0.5:2377 



## Kubernetes 
overlay network are turned off by default per performance reason


## Secrets management
swarm autolock requires keyboard input at boot to decrypt the DB.

swarm does not support capabilities restriction

Threat model :
	Master node access, full cluster control

Overlay network :
 	flat

uses port 2377


## Alternative runtimes
gVisor instead of runc
